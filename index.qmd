**About Me**

My name is Eric Wentz and I am a junior at Macalester College. Majoring in Data Science, I have a passion for data driven sports analytics. I am also on the Varsity Men's basketball team and spend most of my free time practicing the sport. Originally, I am from Minot, North Dakota. Minot is a small town of roughy 40,000 people in North Central North Dakota. I have four older siblings who I wish I got to see more often and I also have a ton of pets. Back home I have 5 cats and 3 dogs.\
